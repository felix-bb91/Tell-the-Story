# Tell the Story

Tell the Story is my first project as Jr Full Stack Web Developer.

## Installation

Running server:
```bash
Go to the server folder
set SP_KEY="your secret key from stripe"
set PORT=5000
npm install
npm start
```

Running front:
```bash
Go to the client folder
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage

You will need a Stripe account to run this app. If you already have a test account in Stripe, go to client side and fill in the component your publick key. 
Once it has been done, go to server side and look for the donations route and fill it with your secret key. Or set it as environment variable.

## Contributing
I will keep this project as it is right now in order to be able to check how I have improved during the following years. 

I am sure that it is full of mistakes/not best practices, any message or comments will be welcome.
